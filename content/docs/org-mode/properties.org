* Properties and Drawers

Org-mode supports properties for metadata and drawers for collapsible content.

** Syntax Example

#+begin_src text
** Task with Properties :task:

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       task-001
:PRIORITY: A
:Effort:   2h
:END:

This is a high-priority task that requires 2 hours of effort.

** Drawer Example

:drawer:
This is content inside a drawer.
It can contain multiple lines.
:end:
#+end_src

** Conversion to MDX

Properties and drawers are currently not converted and may be omitted, above code will convert to

#+begin_src text
## Task with Properties :task:

This is a high-priority task that requires 2 hours of effort.

## Drawer Example

:drawer:
This is content inside a drawer.
It can contain multiple lines.
:end:
#+end_src

This allows properties and drawers to be handled appropriately in the Fumadocs UI.

** Task with Properties :task:

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       task-001
:PRIORITY: A
:Effort:   2h
:END:
