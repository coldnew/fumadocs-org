#+TITLE: Code Blocks with Tangle Example
#+DESCRIPTION: Demonstrating Org-mode source blocks with tangle and exports attributes

* Code Blocks with Tangle

This example shows how Org-mode source blocks with =:tangle= and =:exports none= are converted to MDX code blocks with titles.

** Example Source Block

#+BEGIN_SRC tsx :tangle mdx-components.tsx :exports code
import defaultComponents from 'fumadocs-ui/mdx';
// ...
#+END_SRC

This block should be converted to a code block with title "mdx-components.tsx".

** Another Example

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle utils.py :exports code
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
#+END_SRC

This one has =:exports code= and =:tangle=, so it should be exported with title "utils.py".

** Example with Exports None

#+BEGIN_SRC js :exports none
console.log("This code is not exported");
#+END_SRC

This block has =:exports none=, so it should not appear in the MDX output.
