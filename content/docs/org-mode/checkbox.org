#+DESCRIPTION: Examples of Org-mode checkbox functionality including checked, unchecked, and indeterminate states

* Introduction

Org-mode supports checkboxes in list items, allowing you to track task completion and progress. Checkboxes can be in three states:

- [ ] Unchecked (incomplete task)
- [X] Checked (completed task)
- [-] Indeterminate (partially complete or in progress) - *Not yet supported in Fumadocs' renderer*

* Basic Checkbox Examples

** Unchecked Checkboxes
- [ ] Design the user interface mockups
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Set up continuous integration

** Checked Checkboxes
- [X] Install project dependencies
- [X] Configure development environment
- [X] Create initial project structure
- [X] Set up version control

** Indeterminate Checkboxes
- [-] Deploy to staging environment
- [-] Conduct user testing
- [-] Prepare production deployment

* Project Task List

This example shows a typical project management scenario with checkboxes.

* Progress Tracking

You can use checkboxes to track overall progress:

* Sprint 1 Goals [3/5]
  - [X] Complete user authentication
  - [X] Implement basic CRUD operations
  - [X] Set up project documentation
  - [ ] Add error handling
  - [ ] Performance optimization

* Sprint 2 Goals [1/4]
  - [X] Implement advanced features
  - [ ] Add user notifications
  - [ ] Improve UI/UX
  - [ ] Security audit

* Notes

- Checkboxes are part of Org-mode's list functionality
- They can be nested to create hierarchical task structures
- The indeterminate state ([-]) is useful for tasks that are in progress or partially complete
- *Note: Indeterminate checkboxes ([-]) are not yet supported in Fumadocs' renderer - they appear as literal text (may be implemented in the future)*
- Checkboxes can be toggled using C-c C-c when editing in Emacs
- Statistics cookies like [3/5] can be automatically updated based on checkbox states
