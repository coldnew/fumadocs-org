# Advanced Mathematical Expressions

This document tests complex mathematical expressions to ensure full LaTeX support in the Org-mode to MDX conversion.

## Simple Math

Basic inline: $a + b$

Basic display: $$ x = 1 $$

## Mixed Content Test

This paragraph contains inline math like $E = mc^2$ mixed with regular text.

Warning: Simple expressions work.

## Code

```python
print("Hello")
```

## Tables

| A | B |
| - | - |
| 1 | 2 |

## Final Simple Expression

A simple expression: $$ E = mc^2 $$

This tests basic math rendering.
